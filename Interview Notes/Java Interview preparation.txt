2. Wt r the features u know in java8?
3. Wt is lambda expression?How it is used?
4. Wt is functional programming?
5. Wt is stream api?How it is used?
6. Store the collection of namelist and get the collection of name 
who's length is less than 5.
7. Store the list as map
8. Wt is default method?
A interface -> print()
B interface -> print()

class A
class B
class C ,why  Multiple Inheritance not supported

9. How hashmap work internally?

1. Wt is the version of java u used?
2. Explain abt optional.
3. Wt is functional interface?
4. Why the introduced static and default method?
5. Wt is immutable in java?
6. How hashset internal work?
7. Wt is comparable and comparator interface?


2. Wt happen if hashcode and equal are not override?
3. How you will handle exception?
4. Wt kind of exception we have?
5. Wt is checked and unchecked exception?


1. DateTime


4. Terminal and intermediate function

7. List of name. Find how many names are startswith 'P'.
8. StringOutOfBoundException
9. Concatenate


2. what are the topics/concepts u have used?

4. what is the use lambda expression
5. Convert ArrayList into threadsafe
6. Write a pgm to count  No. of duplicate key
7. Overloading and overridding
8. How many ways you can initialize the class?
9. Wt is constructor and type of constructor?
10. Wt is concurrenthashmap?Internal working 
11. Fail Fast and Fail Safe Iterators in Java

2. Technology known

4. How method reference work?

6. Create a list with names and list the name start with a and print in uppercase
7. Wt is StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

9. Is it possible to create try block without catch block?


3. Create an Employee list object(id,name,age) add i3 objects in List and fetch the
 name alone.

5. Wt is the diff. btwn map and set?
6. As a developer when will you select HashMap and HashSet?
7. In which scenario you will go for HashMap, LinkedHashMap and ConcurrentHashMap.
8. Wt is the purpose of TreeMap?
9. Wt is LinkedHashMap?
10. How JVM and JRE?
11. Wt is class loader?
12. Java is platform independant/dependent?


3.Using streams find sum values of list holding integer values
4. Create a list with String and find the string startswith "s" and store it in new list.
5. Diff btwn arraylist and linkedlist.


object internal methods

treemap and treeset
hashmap and concurrent hashmap
arraylist and linked list
reverse a string

2)Create a Employee Class and add it as a key in HashMap.
2.a) what will happen if u override hashcode to constant value=50?Where it will store?
2.b) What will happen if u didnt override equals method?Where it will store?

4) Filter the name of list greater than 5 length,
4.a) sort the list (need to know both how to sort in stream itself and how to sort
 using comparator for object class)
4.b) reverse the order (need to know how to sort in stream itself)
5)Do the operation with stream.map()
6)What is the difference between filter() and map() in streams.
7)Why java 8 is functional Programming? (Repeated)
8)String storing concept
String s1 = "abc";
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
System.out.println(s1==s2);
9)JDK,JRE,JVM
Complier works and what makes java to platform independent?
What is the use of Class loader?
Complete knowledge about how .java file -> .class file -> execution?
10)What is Multithreading (basic )
11) What is transient keyword?
